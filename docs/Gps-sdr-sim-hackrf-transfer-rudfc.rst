I want to simulate GPS signals by using GPS-SDR-SIM (GPS-SDR-SIM GitHub page) I transfer created signals with HackRF to RTL-SDR. That makes, HackRF become a TX and RTL-SDR become an RX. I try to decode GPS signals which I have received from RTL SDR. I saved received GPS signals as IQ form which gives me  file.  · the easiest is (after configuring your phone in GPS only mode in your settings), put your phone in Airplane mode, start your hackrf_transmit and run GPS Test. It should work:) You can spoof your GPS not too far from where you are really, but I've noticed that meters is already too much ; I guess only tip #1 works.  · The bladeRF command line interface requires I/Q pairs stored as signed bit integers, while the hackrf_transfer and  support signed bytes. HackRF and bladeRF require MHz sample rate, while the USRP2 requires MHz (an even integral decimator of MHz).
