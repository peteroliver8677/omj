Someone hacked my Instagram account and changed my email address,mobile no., username, and password. How can I cancel the account? 48 Views. Well, a lot of instagram users received these emails and many of them have gone to Reddit and Twitter to express their frustration about the matter. That's. If you received an email from security@ letting you know that your email address was changed, you may be able to undo this change by.

My thought is, because I immediately re-registered my Instagram user name, with the original email that I had, somehow I have sabotaged myself of ever getting my original account back using Instagram's automated "I've been hacked" form submission. So let this be a warning to anyone who has their Instagram account hacked: DO NOT RE-REGISTER IT. Same thing just happened to my husband today and the hackers were quick to change his email and phone number on his account. Instagram has the WORST customer service in history. My cousin got hacked a couple months ago and her account was just taken down and deleted. Instagram hacked, email and password changed, but I didn't receive a notification email to my original registration email! Password reset doesn't work, also when I enter my registration email it says "No users found".
